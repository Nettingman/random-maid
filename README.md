# RMG - Random Maid Generator
## Character description
Character generator for the infamous Maid RPG.

This is a small Python project I created when I was still in the early phase of learning programming. It is UGLY. However it works (mostly).

## Backstory
Originally it was created in Python 2 with PyQt4. Much of the sourcecode had been lost, and I could only fully recover it by decompiling an exe version I created back then with py2exe. After that I had to run a PyQt4 >> PyQt5 conversion. I'm planning to clean up the code in the future.

## Necessary tools
* Python 3 
* PyQt5
